# Hall Booking Approval and Notification Workflow Fix

## Issues Fixed

### ❌ **Previous Problems**
1. **Faculty doesn't receive PRO approval notification**
2. **Faculty only receives HOD approval notification** (missing Principal and PRO notifications)
3. **Rejected requests still move to next level** (should stop immediately)
4. **Inconsistent notification messages**

### ✅ **Corrected Behavior**

## Complete Workflow Now Works As Expected:

### 1. **Faculty Books Hall** → HOD Notification ✅
- **Recipient**: HOD
- **Message**: "New booking request from [Faculty] for [Hall] on [Date] requires your approval"
- **Action**: Booking moves to `pending_hod` status

### 2. **HOD Approves** → Faculty + Principal Notifications ✅
- **Faculty receives**: "Your hall booking request has been approved by HOD."
- **Principal receives**: "New booking request for [Hall] on [Date] requires your approval"
- **Action**: Booking moves to `pending_principal` status

### 3. **Principal Approves** → Faculty + PRO Notifications ✅
- **Faculty receives**: "Your hall booking request has been approved by Principal."
- **PRO receives**: "Booking request for [Hall] on [Date] requires final approval"
- **Action**: Booking moves to `pending_pro` status

### 4. **PRO Approves** → Faculty Final Confirmation ✅
- **Faculty receives**: "Your hall booking request has been approved by PRO. The hall is confirmed."
- **Action**: Booking moves to `approved` status (final)

### 5. **Any Rejection** → Faculty Notification + Workflow Stops ✅
- **Faculty receives**: "Your hall booking request has been rejected by [HOD/Principal/PRO] — Reason: [reason provided]."
- **Action**: Booking moves to `rejected` status and **workflow stops immediately**

## Key Improvements

### 🔧 **Database Level Fixes**
- **Proper notification flow**: Faculty receives notification at each approval stage
- **Rejection handling**: Rejections stop the workflow immediately
- **Duplicate prevention**: Enhanced duplicate detection with booking ID comparison
- **Message formatting**: Exact messages as requested

### 🎯 **Notification Messages**
All messages now follow the exact format requested:

**HOD Approval**: "Your hall booking request has been approved by HOD."  
**Principal Approval**: "Your hall booking request has been approved by Principal."  
**PRO Approval**: "Your hall booking request has been approved by PRO. The hall is confirmed."  
**Rejection**: "Your hall booking request has been rejected by [Role] — Reason: [reason provided]."

### 🚫 **Rejection Workflow**
- **Immediate stop**: Rejected bookings don't proceed to next level
- **Clear messaging**: Faculty knows exactly who rejected and why
- **Database integrity**: Rejected status is properly maintained

## Testing the Fix

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Create booking as Faculty** → Check HOD receives notification
