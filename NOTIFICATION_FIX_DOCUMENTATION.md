# Notification Duplication Fix

## Problem Description

The venue booking system was experiencing notification duplication issues where:

- When HOD approves a booking, Faculty receives **two notifications** instead of one
- When Principal approves a booking, Principal also receives **two notifications** for the same request  
- The same issue occurs for PRO approvals
- Multiple notifications were being created for the same approval action

## Root Cause Analysis

The duplication was caused by:

1. **Multiple Database Triggers**: Different migration files created multiple triggers on the same `bookings` table
2. **Multiple Trigger Functions**: Several versions of `handle_booking_status_change()` and `handle_new_booking()` functions existed
3. **Duplicate Notification Calls**: The same notification was being sent multiple times from different trigger functions
4. **No Duplicate Prevention**: The system lacked proper duplicate detection at the database level

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Level Fix

**File**: `supabase/migrations/20250102000000_fix_notification_duplication_final.sql`

- **Removed all duplicate triggers**: Dropped all existing booking-related triggers
- **Created unified functions**: 
  - `send_notification_unified()` - Single notification function with duplicate prevention
  - `handle_new_booking_unified()` - Single new booking handler
  - `handle_booking_status_change_unified()` - Single status change handler
- **Implemented duplicate prevention**: Checks for existing notifications within 2 minutes
- **Created single triggers**: Only one trigger per event type
- **Cleaned up old functions**: Removed all duplicate functions

### 2. Frontend Level Enhancement

**File**: `src/hooks/useNotifications.tsx`

- **Enhanced duplicate detection**: Added booking_id comparison
- **Extended time window**: Increased duplicate detection window to 10 seconds
- **Added logging**: Console logs when duplicates are prevented
- **Improved matching logic**: More precise duplicate detection

### 3. Notification Message Format

The notification messages now follow the exact format requested:

```
"Booking Approval Required — Booking request for [Hall Name] on [Date] at [Time] approved by [HOD/Principal/PRO]."
```

## Key Features of the Fix

### ✅ Duplicate Prevention
- Database-level duplicate detection within 2-minute window
- Frontend-level duplicate detection within 10-second window
- Booking ID-based duplicate checking

### ✅ Single Notification Per Action
- Only one notification created per approval action
- Unified trigger system prevents multiple triggers
- Clean notification flow

### ✅ Maintained Workflow
- Exact same approval flow: Faculty → HOD → Principal → PRO
- Same UI behavior and real-time updates
- Same email notification system
- Same database structure

### ✅ Performance Optimized
- Added database index for duplicate detection
- Efficient notification queries
- Minimal database overhead

## Testing the Fix

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Faculty creates booking** → HOD should receive **1 notification**
2. **HOD approves booking** → Faculty receives **1 notification**, Principal receives **1 notification**
3. **Principal approves booking** → Faculty receives **1 notification**, PRO receives **1 notification**
4. **PRO approves booking** → Faculty receives **1 notification**

### Verification Commands

```sql
-- Check for duplicate notifications
SELECT user_id, type, data->>'booking_id', COUNT(*) as count
FROM notifications 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY user_id, type, data->>'booking_id'
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Clean up any existing duplicates
SELECT cleanup_duplicate_notifications();
```

## Files Modified

1. **Database Migration**: `supabase/migrations/20250102000000_fix_notification_duplication_final.sql`
2. **Frontend Hook**: `src/hooks/useNotifications.tsx`
3. **Documentation**: This file

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the migration can be rolled back by:

1. Dropping the unified triggers
2. Restoring the original trigger functions
3. Recreating the original triggers

## Monitoring

The system now includes:

- Database-level logging for duplicate prevention
- Frontend console logging for duplicate detection
- Performance monitoring through database indexes
- Cleanup function for manual duplicate removal

## Expected Results

After applying this fix:

- ✅ **No more duplicate notifications**
- ✅ **Single notification per approval action**
- ✅ **Proper notification message format**
- ✅ **Maintained existing workflow**
- ✅ **Improved system performance**
- ✅ **Better user experience**

The notification duplication issue has been completely resolved while maintaining all existing functionality and user experience.
