# Hall Availability Fix Documentation

## Problem Fixed
The booking system was incorrectly blocking halls for the entire day instead of only the specific time ranges (start_time to end_time). This affected all halls and prevented proper time-slot based booking.

## Root Cause
The issue was in `src/hooks/useHallAvailability.tsx` at line 97:
```typescript
isAvailable: hallBookings.length === 0
```

This logic made a hall unavailable if it had ANY bookings for today or future dates, regardless of the current time.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Frontend Logic (`src/hooks/useHallAvailability.tsx`)
- **Before**: `isAvailable: hallBookings.length === 0` (blocked entire day)
- **After**: Proper time-based availability checking that only blocks halls during their actual booking times

### 2. New Availability Logic
```typescript
const isCurrentlyAvailable = !currentBooking && (
  hallBookings.length === 0 || 
  !hallBookings.some(booking => {
    const isToday = new Date(booking.event_date).toDateString() === now.toDateString();
    if (!isToday) return false; // Future bookings don't affect current availability
    
    const bookingStartTime = new Date(`${booking.event_date}T${booking.start_time}`);
    const bookingEndTime = new Date(`${booking.event_date}T${booking.end_time}`);
    return now >= bookingStartTime && now <= bookingEndTime;
  })
);
```

### 3. Enhanced Database Functions
Created new database functions in `supabase/migrations/20250101000000_improve_hall_availability.sql`:
- `is_hall_currently_available()`: Considers current time when checking availability
- `get_hall_availability_status()`: Returns detailed availability information with reasons

### 4. Comprehensive Testing
Created `src/components/HallAvailabilityTest.tsx` with:
- Single hall availability testing
- Multi-hall comprehensive testing
- Real-time availability verification
- Detailed test result reporting

## How It Works Now

### ✅ Time-Slot Based Blocking
- **Hall A booked 9-11 AM**: Only unavailable from 9-11 AM, free before and after
- **Hall B booked 1-4 PM**: Only unavailable from 1-4 PM, free at other times
- **Multiple bookings per day**: Same hall can have multiple non-overlapping bookings

### ✅ Real-Time Availability
- **Current time within booking**: Hall shows as "booked"
- **Current time outside booking**: Hall shows as "available"
- **Future bookings**: Don't affect current availability display

### ✅ Overlap Prevention
- Database triggers prevent overlapping bookings for the same hall
- Frontend validation provides immediate feedback
- Each hall is managed independently

### ✅ Automatic Release
- Halls become available immediately after their end_time passes
- No manual intervention required
- Updates every minute automatically

## Testing
Use the `HallAvailabilityTest` component to verify:
1. Different halls can be booked simultaneously for different times
2. Same hall can have multiple bookings on the same day (non-overlapping)
3. Halls become available after their booking end time
4. Overlapping bookings are properly rejected

## Files Modified
- `src/hooks/useHallAvailability.tsx` - Fixed availability logic
- `src/components/HallSwitchDialog.tsx` - Updated to use new functions
- `supabase/migrations/20250101000000_improve_hall_availability.sql` - New database functions
- `src/components/HallAvailabilityTest.tsx` - Comprehensive testing component

## Backward Compatibility
- All existing functionality preserved
- No changes to booking process or UI
- Database triggers remain unchanged
- Only improved the availability calculation logic
